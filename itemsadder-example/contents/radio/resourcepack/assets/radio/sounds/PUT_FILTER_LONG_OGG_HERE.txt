Put your long sound file here as:

  filter_long.ogg

Notes:
- Minecraft/ItemsAdder resource packs do NOT support .mp3; use .ogg (Vorbis).
- This sound is referenced by assets/radio/sounds.json as the event key:

  radio:filter_long

- After placing the file, run ItemsAdder reload/generate as you normally do.
